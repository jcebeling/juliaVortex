# juliaVortex

# Hello! This is my coded solution for BYU FLOW Lab's onboarding project of simulating two leapfroging
#   vortexes traveling through space. To run my solution download the following 3 files:
#   1. leapfroging.jl
#   2. functions.jl
#   3. customTypes.jl

# Make sure they are all in the same directory. Then run the 1st file's code. This requires the Plots and
# LinearAlgebra packages.

# If you have any questions or discover any errors / bugs please let me know at jcebeling@gmail.com
